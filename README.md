Program ........ "Cacti-ReportIT"

Version ........ 1.0

Purpose ........ Create reports

## Developers

* Andreas Braun (aka browniebraun)
* Reinhard Scheck (aka gandalf)

## Purpose

This plugin creates tabular reports which can be exported to CSV, SML and XML as well.

## Features

* Definition of individual report templates by using measurands and variables in a mathematical way
* Definition of report configurations depending on report templates and with different data items
* Individual configuration of working days, working time, timezone and subheads per data item
* Scheduled reporting with sliding time frames
* Provides rounding with binary or decimal SI-Prefixes
* Export to CSV, SML and XML
* Different ways of connecting RRDtool
* Working in localtime supports change to DST and vice versa
* Automatical dispatch of scheduled reports via email
* Generation of top 10 charts
* Report history
* Report per email
* Autoexport to a dedicated folder

## Requirements

Before you install "ReportIT", check the following requirements:

* Cacti 1.1.11 or higher.

To upgrade "ReportIT" release 0.4.0 or higher is required.
A prior version (0.1, 0.2, 0.3.0, 0.3.1, 0.3.2 or 0.4.0a) has to be completely uninstalled (mysql tables as well)!
Therefore you can use uninstall.php.

Optional:
To use the full set of ReportIT's functionalities additional extensions are required

* Fast report generation:  PHP extension "php_rrdtool"

## Installation

The Installation of ReportIT is similar to other plugins:

* Unpack the tar-file into the plugins folder. It contains a folder called "reportit".
* Go to the Plugin Management Console and click on "Install".
* Start Cacti and update your realm permissions under "Utilities/User Management".
* Update ReportIT's settings under "Configuration/Settings/Reports".

## Upgrade

To upgrade an existing version of ReportIT please ensure that its release number is v0.4.0 or above. It's strongly recommended to make a backup of your cacti database and your ReportIT folder before! If you're using the default archive folder of 0.6.x save it first!!!  After that replace your existing ReportIT folder with the new one stored in this download archive.  Go to the plugin management console and click on "install". The upgrade process will start automatically!  After it has finished you can enable ReportIT with a click on "enable".

ReportIT does not require that your webserver has write access to any folder.  But if the history function should be in use, you will have to ensure that the user, who executes the calculation of your scheduled reports via Crontab or another scheduler, will have write access to the folders called "tmp" and "archive".  Same has to be ensured for the export folder.  At least change to the Cacti Webinterface and check the settings under "Console->Settings->Reports".

## Feature Requests?

At first it's recommend to discuss your feature request with the Cacti community.  After that you should open a feature request under https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=201406&atid=977438 to keep it in mind.
